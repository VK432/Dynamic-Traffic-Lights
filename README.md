# Dynamic-Traffic-Lights
A simulation exploring the effects of different dynamic traffic light systems on traffic flow across a cross roads. 
**Done as part of a group project at The University of Bristol**

Either download and run the compiled application.macosx or application.win32. 
To edit the program first dowload and install Processing(https://processing.org/download/), then download the traffic folder and run the traffic.pde.
A full descrption of how the different dynamic traffic light systems work is availabe in the FinalPresentation.pptx(Reading the notes for each slide of necessary detail).

### Brief overview

Method 1:
	Assigns priority based on total wait time.

Method 2:
	Assigns priority based on highest wait time.

Method 3:
	Assigns priority based on product of wait times.

Method 4:
	Number of cars in the lane.

Method 5:
	Fixed timer system.

### Controls
You can control the rate of traffic with '+' and '-', changed between fixed/dynamic pattern changes with 'f', and change the method for getting the priority of each car with with ']'
